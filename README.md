# Random Forest Regression on Position Salaries

## Project Overview
This project implements a Random Forest Regression model to predict salaries based on position levels. It uses Python along with libraries such as sklearn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data processing and modeling.

## Contents
- Jupyter Notebook with Python code (`main.ipynb`)
- Dataset (`Position_Salaries.csv`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saeed-rhimi/randomForestRegression
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
- Run the Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) to see the implementation of the Random Forest Regression model.
- The notebook contains sections for data loading, preprocessing, model building, prediction, and visualization.

## Code Description
1. **Import Libraries**: Imports pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
2. **Load Dataset**: Loads `Position_Salaries.csv`.
3. **Data Preparation**: Splits the dataset into features and target variable.
4. **Model Building**: Builds and trains the Random Forest Regressor.
5. **Model Prediction**: Predicts salary for a specific position level.
6. **Visualization**: Visualizes the actual data points and model predictions.
7. **Empty Cell**: Placeholder for potential future code or comments.

## Dataset
The `Position_Salaries.csv` file contains data on different position levels and their corresponding salaries, used for training the Random Forest model.
